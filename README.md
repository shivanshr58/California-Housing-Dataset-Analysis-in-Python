# California Housing Dataset Analysis

The California Housing Dataset provides comprehensive information about housing in California, making it a valuable resource for SQL querying and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This analysis aims to delve into various aspects of the dataset, including median housing prices, income, and more, to uncover insights and trends.

## Features Classification

- **Nominal Data**:
  - Ocean Proximity: Categorical data representing the proximity of the house to the ocean.
  
- **Ordinal Data**:
  - None
  
- **Discrete Data**:
  - Population: Represents the total population in a block.
  - Households: Denotes the total number of households in a block.
  - Total Bedrooms: Indicates the total number of bedrooms in a block.
  
- **Continuous Data**:
  - Median Income: Continuous numerical data representing the median income of households in a block.
  - Median House Value: Continuous numerical data indicating the median value of houses in a block.
  - Latitude: Continuous numerical data representing the latitude of the location.
  - Longitude: Continuous numerical data indicating the longitude of the location.
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted using Python's popular libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The analysis included the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Deriving new features and transformations where necessary.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Calculating descriptive statistics for numerical features.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizing various plots (scatter plots, histograms, box plots, etc.) to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends among variables.

## User Defined Functions

User-defined functions were employed to handle specific columns where data segregation was required. These functions facilitated efficient data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Conclusion

The analysis of the California Housing Dataset provides valuable insights into housing trends and patterns in California. Further analysis and modeling can be performed based on the findings to derive actionable insights for various stakeholders.
